    <h2>Detroit Style Pizza Recipe</h2>
    <p>Forget the old Chicago vs. NY debate! America's best pizza could very well be Detroit-style pizza. 
     Even though it's often referred to as 'deep dish,' I don't think that accurately captures the essence of this crispy, crusty, crazy-good slice. 
     It has flavor elements of a slightly charred thin-crust pizza, with the texture of light, airy focaccia. 
     Plus, if you use the properly shaped pan, the edges of your crust get wonderfully crunchy, making for a truly unique experience.</p>
